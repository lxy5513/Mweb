How to use OpenCV in C++
Using CMakeLists.txt

The basic structure of your CMakeLists.txt will be as follows:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
# Enable C++11
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED TRUE)
You will have to set OpenCV_DIR as shown below.


SET(OpenCV_DIR <OpenCV_Home_Dir>/installation/OpenCV-master/lib/cmake/opencv4)
Make sure that you replace OpenCV_Home_Dir with correct path. For example, in my case:


SET(OpenCV_DIR /home/hp/OpenCV_installation/installation/OpenCV-master/lib/cmake/opencv4)
Once you have made your CMakeLists.txt, follow the steps given below.
``` 




```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
This will generate your executable file in build directory.

```
