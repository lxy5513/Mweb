# OPENSSL 

OpenSSL 是一个软件库，用于通信安全。包含一个对SSL、TLS协议的开源实现。




cacert.pem is a bundle of CA certificates that you use to verify that the server is really the correct site you're talking to (when it presents its certificate in the SSL handshake). The bundle can be used by tools like curl or wget, as well as other TLS/SSL speaking software. The bundle should contain the certificates for the CAs you trust. This bundle is sometimes referred to as the "CA cert store".

1. User java keytool to create keystore
         
            keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias mms -keystore keystore.p12 -storepass changeit -storetype PKCS12 -validity 3600 -keysize 2048 -dname "CN=www.MY_MMS.com, OU=Cloud Service, O=model server, L=Palo Alto, ST=California, C=US"
            
            
            
            Config following property in config.properties:

            inference_address=https://127.0.0.1:8443
            management_address=https://127.0.0.1:8444
            keystore=keystore.p12
            keystore_pass=changeit
            keystore_type=PKCS12
       
2. User OpenSSL to create private key and certificate
    
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365

    
    
    
    
    
    
1. 客户端获取 certificate
    
        Example:

        curl --cacert cacert.pem https://example.com
