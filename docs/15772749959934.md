To view the file permissions of a set of files, use:

```
ls -lha
```

In the first column of the output, there are 10 characters that represent the permission bits. To understand why they are called permission bits, see the section on [octal notation](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/modify-file-permissions-with-chmod/#octal-notation) below.

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group       4.0K 2009-08-13 10:16 docs
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group       8.1K 2009-07-09 16:23 roster.py
lrwxrwxrwx 2 user group       4.0K 2009-08-13 10:16 team.docs
```

A way to understand the meaning of this column is to divide the bits into groups.

| File type         | User  | Group | Global |
| :---------------- | :---- | :---- | :----- |
| `d` Directory     | `rwx` | `r-x` | `r-x`  |
| `-` Regular file  | `rw-` | `r--` | `r--`  |
| `l` Symbolic Link | `rwx` | `rwx` | `rwx`  |


## chmod 
chmod [-R][who][+,-,=][permissions] filename
    
    who: u(user) g(group) o(other) a(all) 
    
    The + operator grants permissions whereas the - operator takes away permissions. The parameter g=u means grant group permissions to be same as the user’s.
    
    The -R option applies the modification to the permissions recursively to the directory 
    
    
## chgrp 
change group 
    chgrp [-R] groupname myfile 
    
    
## chown 
chown [-R] username:group directory
