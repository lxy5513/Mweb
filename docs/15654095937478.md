# 加载库 


example：
lib_path = /path/to/libtorch  

- export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=lib_path 
- cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=lib_path . 
- list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/ssd2/xyliu/projects/libtorch/libtorch_cpu") #直接写在CMakelists.txt上

```
Setting the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable will make the find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED) command 
pick your OpenCV installation in /home/me/src/opencv 
and set the OpenCV_LIBS and OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIR variables accordingly.

Alternatively you can edit a CMakeCache.txt file of an existing build directory with the CMake GUI editor and add the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH definition there. You have to re-configure your project then.
