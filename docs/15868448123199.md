# default ipython

设置ipython默认包和自制代码

1. Create the default profile, if it doesn't exist already (it probably does):

    `ipython profile create`


2. Make a Python script ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/whateveryouwant.py 
and add any imports or other commands in there that you would like to have ready whenever you start IPython. IPython will run this script and any others in that directory every time it starts up.
